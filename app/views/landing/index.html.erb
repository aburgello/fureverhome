    <h2>Why Adopt?</h2>
    <p>
        Adopting a pet isn’t just about giving them a new home; it’s about giving them a second chance at a happy, fulfilling life.
        When you adopt, you’re saving a life and opening your heart to an endless source of love and joy. From reducing the number of
        homeless animals to gaining a loyal companion, the impact of adoption is truly life-changing for both you and your new furry friend.
